              <h3>FAVORITE BIBLE VERSE</h3>
              <p>Isaiah 40:31 - 'But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will mount up on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.'</p>
              <h3>CERTIFICATIONS</h3>
              <p>NSCA Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist</p>
              <p>Level 1 Precision Nutrition Certified Coach</p>
              <h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>
              <p>I grew up in the Greater Kansas City area primarily playing basketball and later got into track and cross country. When I was in 4th grade I was cut from a competitive basketball team and was told that I lacked the speed, strength, and stamina to compete at the higher level of competition. Rather than being bitter, I made the choice to get better. I attended multiple camps & completed multiple strength training programs so I could continue playing basketball. I ended up turning some of my biggest weaknesses into some of my most powerful assets. I've won big tournaments, state championships, and even national championships, but I've also undergone really tough adversity in my time as an athlete and as a coach. I've had to deal with getting cut from teams, losing playing time, and fighting injuries.
              I am so thankful for the opportunity to coach this camp. It’s a huge blessing to work with so many talented and hard-working individuals. As a coach, my goal is to do everything in my power to help youth athletes grow into young men and women who will succeed in life.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE PART ABOUT CAMP</h3>
              <p>I enjoy developing personal relationships with camp participants. I love seeing their growth at camp spread to other aspects of life.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE WORKOUT</h3>
              <p>Maximum Velocity Sprint Technique – I love teaching athletes how to be faster and more efficient runners at top speed</p>
              <h3>FUN FACT ABOUT COACH LARS</h3>
              <p>All of Lars' ancestors were Norwegian, so he is 100% Scandinavian (evident by his very blonde hair!)</p>

              <h3>MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
              <p>I coach to connect with athletes of all ages on a personal level and assist them in achieving their goals.</p>
              <h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>
              <p>I grew up playing soccer and basketball from a young age and added swimming later on. I was obsessed with the competitive nature that athletics brought. I swam for Nottingham by the Green, Olathe lightning, COOL, and Olathe East. I played soccer for Avelino, KCFC, Sporting Blue Valley and Olathe East. I played Basketball for the Crush, which is where I met Lars. Lars pushed me to the next level as an athlete. I have him to thank for making the 8th grade basketball team after being cut the year before and achieving the various awards in soccer that I have accumulated over time. The experience that Lars has given me allows me to coach all the wonderful athletes in Ignite and I am blessed to make such great connections with them as we work towards becoming better athletes.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE PART ABOUT CAMP</h3>
              <p>Getting to hear the amazing accomplishments that the athletes make and the stories that go along with them.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE WORKOUT</h3>
              <p>All of our core-strength workouts</p>
              <h3>FUN FACT</h3>
              <p>In his junior year of high school, Logan was named team captain of the soccer team. He broke his fibula during the first game of the season, but was able to return mid-season and lead the team to a State Championship victory!</p>

              <p>Philippians 4:13- I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</p>
              <h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>
              <p>I attended camp for the past 6 years, and began coaching last year. Wanting to constantly improve myself athletically, I excelled on the football field and in the weight room. With healthier eating habits, and more disciplined workouts I have returned from injuries (torn labrum and fractured tibia), and am now in the best shape of my life. This past year, I was able to hold a starting position on the Olathe East Varsity Football team as both a quarterback and running back.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE PART ABOUT CAMP</h3>
              <p>I love seeing the tremendous improvements over the course of the summer, as well as the friendships created with the camp participants.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE WORKOUT</h3>
              <p>Upper Body Days - I love seeing kids push themselves, and increase their upper body strength. They don't call me "Coach Forearms" for nothing!</p>
              <h3>FUN FACT</h3>
              <p>I train for American Ninja Warrior with Lars, and I plan to apply for the show when I'm old enough.</p>

              <h3>FAVORITE BIBLE VERSE</h3>
              <p>2 Timothy 4:7 "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith"</p>
              <h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>
              <p>When I was little I grew up playing soccer. I started out in a recreational league and eventually worked my way up to more competitive teams. I started playing competitive soccer when I was in 5th grade then moved to a club team when I was in 6th grade playing with 7th graders. In middle school I ran track and cross country and loved both of those sports as well. I soon found out I really liked distance running. In the transition from middle school to high school I had to make the decision to run cross country or tryout for school soccer. In the end I chose to run cross country for Olathe East and qualified as an individual for the State Championships my freshman year and placed 21st. In the spring of my freshman year I ran track for school and played soccer for club. I realized after a whole year of running school track and cross country running my passion is distance running.
This is my first year of coaching Ignite. I helped coach my younger brother’s soccer team this past year including setting up summer runs before their season started and doing some conditioning during practices once their season had started. I enjoy working with younger kids and athletes and love watching them progress and get stronger throughout the season.</p>

              <h3>FUN FACT</h3>
              <p>I have never had a cavity or broken a bone!</p>

              <h3>COACHING STATEMENT</h3>
              <p>I coach to help youth build a strong foundation for the road ahead</p>
              <h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>
              <p>As a child, soccer, baseball, and basketball quickly consumed many hours and weekends. Along the way, I played under remarkable coaches who helped apply lessons from sports to other aspects of my life. Coaches like my dad and Lars have helped guide me to the true meanings of success. Success is not found in victories and championships: It’s found in hearts, in effort, and in perseverance. I have 10+ years of experience playing both baseball and basketball, but I have narrowed my personal focus toward long-distance running. I will be attending Colorado Christian University on a Cross-Country and Track scholarship this fall.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE PART ABOUT CAMP</h3>
              <p>I personally love the family component of how the athletes and coaches interact with each other to create a atmosphere that is both welcoming and competitive.</p>
              <h3>FAVORITE WORKOUT</h3>
              <p>I prefer intense speed workouts like the Coe Cutdown</p>
              <h3>FUN FACT</h3>
              <p>Anders is a 3-time team track state champion at Olathe East.</p>
